# Datadog Telemetry

## What this source contains

Datadog holds the runtime record, what actually happened in production, as opposed to what was planned or discussed.

- **Metrics.** Counters, gauges, histograms instrumented by the team. A metric's *presence* is itself evidence. Someone thought this number worth watching.
- **Monitors & alerts.** Conditions the team decided warranted waking someone up. A monitor firing on `rate_limit_hit > 10/min` is direct evidence the team worried about that threshold.
- **Dashboards.** Curated views. The charts tell you what the team considers important for a subsystem.
- **APM traces & spans.** Request-level runtime data. Useful for "why is this slow" / "why is there a timeout here" questions.
- **Logs.** High-volume event records. Often contain the error conditions that motivated defensive code.
- **Incidents.** Formal incident records with timelines and linked postmortems.
- **Notebooks.** Exploratory investigations. Often contain hypotheses and analyses.

Datadog answers "what was the production reality around the time this code was written?", which often explains the code's shape.

## How to search it

{{runtime.integrations}}

Use an actually discovered authenticated infrastructure-observability read connector (Datadog is an example). Inspect supported operations rather than assuming names from another client. Missing access is an infrastructure coverage gap.

1. Identify the owning services and available dependency graph.
2. Search dashboards and monitors by service, team, feature, and symbol. Record the actual queries, watched thresholds, owner, and creation dates.
3. Read metric metadata (units, descriptions, tags), then time-bounded series around the change date. Ask whether a spike predates the PR and whether adjacent changes explain the decline.
4. Search logs by service, symbol, error text, and tight date window (usually about 30 days around the change). Prefer bounded pattern/aggregate reads over raw dumps; widen only for a stated reason.
5. Aggregate span statistics, inspect representative spans, and fetch referenced traces if those read capabilities exist. They expose retries, timeouts, slow paths, and service boundaries.
6. Fetch relevant incident timelines and linked postmortems. Preserve links, IDs, exact conditions/quotes, and gaps from missing retention or unsupported operations.

## What good evidence looks like here

- A monitor whose query and threshold match the constraint the code enforces (code clamps to 100, monitor alerts when requests exceed 100/min)
- A dashboard created by the target's author, with widgets that correspond to what the code measures or guards against
- A metric showing a production spike immediately before the code was merged, and stable values after
- An incident record referencing the target code, the same symbols, or the same error strings
- Logs showing a specific error pattern the defensive code would prevent, timestamped in the window before the change

## Common pitfalls

- **Correlation is not causation.** A spike before a PR and stabilization after is suggestive, not definitive. Other changes may have landed in the same window. Check neighboring PRs.
- **Overfitting to the chart you found.** Datadog visualizations are *made* by humans and reflect that human's framing. A chart named "retry success rate" is evidence the team cared about retry success, not that it's why a specific line of code exists.
- **Vanished telemetry.** Metrics can be renamed, deleted, or have short retention. If you can't find data from the relevant window, that's a gap, not a null result.
- **Noise at scale.** Searching logs for a common string returns thousands of matches. Narrow by service, tag, and time aggressively. Use the connector's actually available read-only aggregate operation rather than dumping raw logs.
- **Instrumented != caused.** A metric's existence tells you someone cared enough to measure something, not that the code was added *because* of it. Cross-reference with commit/PR dates.

## What to return

For each relevant item:
- Type (dashboard / monitor / metric / log pattern / trace / incident / notebook)
- Title or name
- Link or identifier (dashboard ID, monitor ID, metric name, incident ID)
- Owner/author and created/modified date
- The specific condition, query, or quote that bears on the question (verbatim where possible)
- Relevance: what this suggests about the target code, and how strong the connection is
