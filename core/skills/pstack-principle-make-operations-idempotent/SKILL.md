# Make Operations Idempotent

## When to Use

Use when designing state-changing operations that may retry or crash.

## Procedure

Design operations so they converge to the correct state regardless of how many times they run or where they start from. Every state-mutating operation should answer: "What happens if this runs twice? What happens if the previous run crashed halfway?"

**Why:** Commands, lifecycle operations, and processing loops run where crashes, restarts, and retries are normal. If partial state changes the next run's outcome, every restart becomes a debugging session.

**The pattern:**
- Convergent startup: scan for existing state, clean stale artifacts, adopt live sessions
- Content-based cleanup: compare by content equivalence, not creation order
- Self-healing locks: use PID-based stale lock detection
- Idempotent scheduling: failed work respawns cleanly, fresh input regenerated after each cycle

**The test:**
1. What happens if this runs twice in a row?
2. What happens if the previous run crashed at every possible point?
3. Does re-execution converge to the same end state?

If any answer is "it depends on what state was left behind," the operation needs a reconciliation step.

## Pitfalls

Reconciliation and cleanup need explicit ownership; stale-state detection must not delete another actor's live state.

Stay within the user's task scope and available capabilities. This principle does not authorize publication, merges, destructive cleanup, or configuration changes; preserve approval gates and compatibility commitments.

## Verification

Execute twice from clean and existing state, then inject interruption at each mutation boundary in an isolated fixture. Re-execution must converge to the same content and ownership without duplicated work or unsafe cleanup. State the decision changed, retain actual evidence, and disclose remaining uncertainty.
