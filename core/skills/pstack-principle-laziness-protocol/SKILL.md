# Laziness Protocol

## When to Use

Use when refactoring or when an implementation grows layers and coordination.

## Procedure

Aim for the most result with the least code and complexity.

- **Prefer deletion.** When asked to refactor or improve, look for removals before additions.
- **Maintain a flat call hierarchy.** Avoid deep call chains. A rich interface that hides substantial work is not a deep call chain. If answering a question requires tracing through more than 3 files or layers, flatten it.
- **Consolidate decisions.** Do not repeat the same choice in several places. Put it behind one source of truth and pass the result as a simple flag.
- **Minimize the diff.** Make the smallest change that solves the problem. Fewer lines beat "elegant" boilerplate.
- **Question the threading.** If a task asks you to pass a new signal through types, schemas, pipelines, or similar layers, stop and look for a more direct path.
- **Sweat the small leaks.** Remove tiny pass-throughs, representation leaks, and duplicated choices before they spread. Small leaks compound into permanent coordination costs.

**The test:** If a human developer would find the code exhausting to maintain, it is a bad solution.

## Pitfalls

A rich interface hiding real complexity can be useful. Fewer lines alone do not justify changing required behavior.

Stay within the user's task scope and available capabilities. This principle does not authorize publication, merges, destructive cleanup, or configuration changes; preserve approval gates and compatibility commitments.

## Verification

Show the removed code, consolidated decisions, and reduced tracing path. Run relevant behavior checks and explain any remaining signal threading or layer in terms of complexity it actually hides. State the decision changed, retain actual evidence, and disclose remaining uncertainty.
