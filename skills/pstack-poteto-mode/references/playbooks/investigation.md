### Investigation

**You own the answer. Plan, route, write.**

Investigation requests are read-only. They produce a cited explanation or a recommendation, not a code change.

1. Route through the **pstack-how** skill. For motivation questions, also route through the **pstack-why** skill.
2. Throughput checkpoint stays one line: `throughput checkpoint: n/a, read-only investigation`.
3. Produce the `pstack-how`-shaped output (Overview / Key Concepts / How It Works / Where Things Live / Gotchas), or a recommendation with a tradeoffs table if the request is a decision between alternatives.
4. Apply the **pstack-unslop** skill to the reply.

No PR, no babysit, no `pstack-architect` unless the investigation precedes a code change. If it does, hand back to the user and re-route to Bug fix or Feature.

**Reply:** the investigation output. For "are we sure?" answers, include your real judgment with reasons. Push back if the premise is wrong (see Autonomy).


**Hermes boundaries.** Read this skill's `references/hermes-runtime.md`. All child work is leaf-only, with a standalone brief and isolated writable paths; the parent flattens dependent waves. Default delegation is independent same-model work, not model diversity. Publication, merges, configuration, installs, destructive cleanup and durable scheduling require explicit relevant scope. A missing runtime capability is a gap. Use bullets instead of markdown tables on Discord.
