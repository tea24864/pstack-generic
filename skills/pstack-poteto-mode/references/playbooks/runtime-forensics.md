### Runtime forensics

**You own the diagnosis. Instrument the live process, don't theorize from source.** The deliverable is a cited diagnosis, not a fix.

Use available browser or desktop helpers and actual vision for visual evidence. If a browser form requests credentials, address or card fields, first call `browser_vault_list` and the appropriate vault fill/save tool; codes use `browser_vault_enter_code`. Never solicit or type secrets in chat. Discover webhook/MCP facilities from the real session and current official documentation before proposing setup.

1. Capture the live signal on the matching surface via the verified browser, desktop, or shell surface driver: a CPU profile for a spinning process, a heap snapshot for a leak, a CDP trace for a visual glitch. A real artifact, not a guess.
2. Reduce the artifact to the smoking gun: the function on the hot path, the retainer chain from the leaked object to a GC root, the loop firing without input. Parse large artifacts in a subagent (the **pstack-principle-guard-the-context-window** principle skill), keep the reduced finding in the main thread.
3. Prove the mechanism before believing it. Inject instrumentation via CDP eval on the running process, or apply narrowly scoped temporary instrumentation only when authorized, to confirm the hypothesis cheaply.
4. Map the finding back to source: file, symbol, the line that allocates or schedules.
5. Throughput checkpoint stays one line: `throughput checkpoint: n/a, read-only forensics`.

**Reply:** the signal captured, the reduced finding, how you proved the mechanism, the source location, artifact paths. No fix unless asked. Hand back to Bug fix or Perf once the cause is known.


**Permission boundary.** Publication, merges, configuration changes, installs, destructive cleanup and durable scheduling require explicit relevant scope. Missing evidence or capability is a gap, not a pass. Concurrent writers need exclusive ownership; the coordinator relays dependencies. Use bullets instead of Markdown tables where the delivery surface does not support tables.
