# Attack the Premise

## When to Use

Use when challenge shared assumptions after repeated failed fixes. Do not treat a design principle as a mandate to expand the task.

## Prerequisites

Read `references/hermes-runtime.md` with `skill_view` before executing this workflow. Use only tools and credentials actually available in this session. Invoking this skill does not authorize publication, merges, destructive cleanup, or configuration changes.

## Procedure

When two or more fixes that share one premise have failed the same gate, suspect the premise, not the fixes.

**Why:** Each failure under a shared premise is evidence about the premise.

**Pattern:**
- **Write the premise down.** The premise is the one sentence that every failed fix assumed.
- **Take a census before the next fix.** Count the imbalance per actor. The census shows which actors hold the imbalance, not how large it is. Write the census as a rerunnable script per [Build the Lever](../pstack-principle-build-the-lever/SKILL.md).
- **Read the skew.** If the same few actors hold most of the imbalance on every run, something assigns them that role. Find what assigns the role. That assignment is the next "why" per [Fix Root Causes](../pstack-principle-fix-root-causes/SKILL.md).
- **Remove the asymmetry instead of compensating for it**, per the [Laziness Protocol](../pstack-principle-laziness-protocol/SKILL.md). Rotate the role between actors, randomize the assignment, or move the role, so that no actor holds it on every run. A return path, a shared pool, a batched hand-off, or a periodic rebalance leaves the assignment in place and adds work on every run.

**Stop:**
- Do not start the next fix before the premise is written down and the census exists.
- If the census is even across actors, the premise is not the cause. Look for the cause elsewhere and keep the census as evidence.

This principle is distinct from [Redesign from First Principles](../pstack-principle-redesign-from-first-principles/SKILL.md), which rebuilds a design around a new requirement. It questions a fact the current design assumes.


## Pitfalls

Apply the rule to observed constraints, not as an absolute ban. Preserve approval gates, compatibility contracts, and higher-priority user instructions. The runtime contract defines tool and profile boundaries.

## Verification

Name the concrete decision this principle changed and the artifact or evidence that supports it. For execution claims, use real tool output; for a design judgment, state its constraints and remaining uncertainty.
