# Build the Lever

## When to Use

Use when build rerunnable tools for nontrivial work and checks. Do not treat a design principle as a mandate to expand the task.

## Prerequisites

Read `references/hermes-runtime.md` with `skill_view` before executing this workflow. Use only tools and credentials actually available in this session. Invoking this skill does not authorize publication, merges, destructive cleanup, or configuration changes.

## Procedure

When the work isn't trivial, build the tool that does it instead of doing it by hand.

**Why:** Two payoffs. Throughput: a codemod, generator, or script does the work the same way every time and reruns for free. Confidence: the tool is one artifact a reviewer can read and rerun to check the work. Hand-done changes can only be re-verified by redoing them. A deterministic script turns "trust me" into "run this".

**Pattern:** Default to building the lever. Skip it only when the task is trivial, a couple of obvious edits you can see at a glance.

- Do the first unit by hand to learn the recipe, then build the tool. Prove it by rerunning it on that unit and diffing against your hand-done version. Make the lever safe to rerun.
- Codemod or script for edits, generator for repetitive files, a dump-to-sqlite query for analysis, a rerunnable check for verification.
- A deterministic lever beats fan-out. If the tool can process every unit in one pass, run it yourself. Don't fan out delegates to hand-apply what a script can do.
- When you fan work out to subagents, write the lever as a skill they all read: the recipe, the verification contract, and the do-not-touch fences in one artifact. Keep it outside the delegates' write scope so they can't quietly edit the contract.
- Applying this principle produces a file. If you cited it and there is no codemod, script, generator, or delegate skill in the diff, you didn't apply it.
- Commit the lever when the work outlives the session.

**Balance:** The bar is triviality, not repetition. A one-off still earns a lever when the lever is what makes the work checkable. Per the [Laziness Protocol](../pstack-principle-laziness-protocol/SKILL.md), build the smallest script that does or proves the job, never a framework.

Distinct from [Encode Lessons in Structure](../pstack-principle-encode-lessons-in-structure/SKILL.md), which makes a recurring instruction a durable guardrail. This is throughput and reviewability on the work in front of you. For scripting the verification itself, see [Prove It Works](../pstack-principle-prove-it-works/SKILL.md).


## Pitfalls

Apply the rule to observed constraints, not as an absolute ban. Preserve approval gates, compatibility contracts, and higher-priority user instructions. The runtime contract defines tool and profile boundaries.

## Verification

Name the concrete decision this principle changed and the artifact or evidence that supports it. For execution claims, use real tool output; for a design judgment, state its constraints and remaining uncertainty.
