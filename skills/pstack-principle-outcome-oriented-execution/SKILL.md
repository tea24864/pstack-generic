# Outcome-Oriented Execution

## When to Use

Use when verify end states at explicit migration boundaries. Do not treat a design principle as a mandate to expand the task.

## Prerequisites

Read `references/hermes-runtime.md` with `skill_view` before executing this workflow. Use only tools and credentials actually available in this session. Invoking this skill does not authorize publication, merges, destructive cleanup, or configuration changes.

## Procedure

Optimize for the intended, verifiable end state rather than preserving smooth intermediate states.

**Why:** Keeping every intermediate step fully stable often creates temporary compatibility code that becomes long-lived debt. Converge on the target architecture and prove correctness at explicit verification boundaries.

**Core rule:**
- Prioritize end-state integrity over transitional stability
- Intermediate breakage is acceptable when it is planned, scoped, and reversible

**Guardrails:**
- Use this for planned rewrites and migrations with explicit phase boundaries
- Declare where temporary breakage is acceptable
- Keep high-signal checks for actively touched areas while migrating
- Require full static and runtime verification at plan completion


Honor compatibility promises to external users and shared production uptime. Planned intermediate breakage belongs only in the explicitly approved isolated migration scope.

## Pitfalls

Apply the rule to observed constraints, not as an absolute ban. Preserve approval gates, compatibility contracts, and higher-priority user instructions. The runtime contract defines tool and profile boundaries.

## Verification

Name the concrete decision this principle changed and the artifact or evidence that supports it. For execution claims, use real tool output; for a design judgment, state its constraints and remaining uncertainty.
