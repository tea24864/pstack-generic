# Explain the Number

## When to Use

Use when validate what measured numbers actually demonstrate. Do not treat a design principle as a mandate to expand the task.

## Prerequisites

Read `references/hermes-runtime.md` with `skill_view` before executing this workflow. Use only tools and credentials actually available in this session. Invoking this skill does not authorize publication, merges, destructive cleanup, or configuration changes.

## Procedure

A measured number is a claim about a system. Before you trust it, report it, or act on it, find what limits it and rule out that it measured something else.

**Why:** A run that went wrong still prints a plausible number. Requests that failed, a cache that skipped the work, code that never ran, a side left on default settings, and run-to-run noise all produce results that look fine. If you cannot say why the number is not twice as good, you do not know what you measured.

**Pattern:**

- **Ask "why not double?"** Name the resource or code path that bounds the result, such as a core, a lock, the disk, the network, or the load generator itself. Get it from a profile or from system counters taken during a run, then map it to source. A guess from reading the code is not a limiter.
- **List what else the number could be measuring, and rule out each one with evidence.** The usual suspects are errors, skipped or cached work, an untuned side, noise, and a piece too small to matter end to end.
- **Keep the evidence with the number.** Put the run count, the spread, and the limiter in the notes or a linked artifact, so a reader can check the claim.

For a performance number, run the full procedure with the [benchmark-checklist](../pstack-benchmark-checklist/SKILL.md) skill. For an eval result, ask the same of the trials: did every run do the task, does the gap hold across trials and models, and does the scenario matter.

You skipped this when the evidence behind a number has no run count, no spread, or no named limiter, or when the time saved is larger than the time the changed piece took.

Distinct from [Prove It Works](../pstack-principle-prove-it-works/SKILL.md), which checks that an output is real. This checks that a measured number means what you say it means.


## Pitfalls

Apply the rule to observed constraints, not as an absolute ban. Preserve approval gates, compatibility contracts, and higher-priority user instructions. The runtime contract defines tool and profile boundaries.

## Verification

Name the concrete decision this principle changed and the artifact or evidence that supports it. For execution claims, use real tool output; for a design judgment, state its constraints and remaining uncertainty.
